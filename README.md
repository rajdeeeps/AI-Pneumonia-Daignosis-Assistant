# AI-Pneumonia-Daignosis-Assistant
This project is an AI-powered medical diagnosis assistant that identifies pneumonia from chest X-ray images using deep learning. Built with PyTorch and trained on a Kaggle dataset, the model leverages the ResNet18 architecture to accurately classify whether a patient has pneumonia or not.
